**HSIP Roadmap**

HSIP is a consent-first communication protocol that gives users control over who can reach them, how, and for how long — using cryptographic proof instead of trust. The roadmap below highlights the major stages of development without disclosing internal strategy or implementation details.

**Phase 1 — Core Foundation (Completed)**
Identity and key management
Consent-based session initiation
Encrypted transport layer
Basic reputation filtering
Initial Rust tooling and documentation
Windows gateway and CLI utilities
This phase establishes the minimal, secure foundation of HSIP.

**Phase 2 — Cross-Platform Expansion**
Goal: Make HSIP accessible on all major desktop platforms.
Linux and macOS support
Native integration (tray/menu bar)
Unified installer packages
Platform-consistent user experience
Expanded documentation
This phase focuses on accessibility and developer adoption.

**Phase 3 — Mobile & Lightweight Devices**
Goal: Bring HSIP’s consent model to mobile and embedded environments.
Mobile libraries and bindings
Background-safe consent flows
Example mobile applications
Optimized resource usage
This phase opens the door to mainstream applications and everyday use cases.

**Phase 4 — Advanced Networking Capabilities**
Goal: Improve connectivity, resilience, and optional peer discovery.
More robust network traversal
Optional privacy-preserving discovery
Diagnostics and performance tools
This phase strengthens reliability for diverse network conditions.

**Phase 5 — Group Communication**
Goal: Enable multi-party interaction with explicit consent at group scale.
Group session management
Group consent flows
Scalable group communication models
This phase expands HSIP beyond 1:1 interaction.

**Phase 6 — Enterprise Readiness**
Goal: Prepare HSIP for formal adoption in regulated and large-scale environments.
Production hardening
Optional enterprise tooling
Expanded monitoring and deployment support
Additional security review
This phase supports organizations that require long-term stability and guaranteed support.
Long-Term Vision

##HSIP aims to become a universal, consent-based communication layer for privacy-respecting systems.##

**Future areas of exploration include:**
stronger cryptographic guarantees
formal verification
privacy-enhancing network techniques
lightweight implementations for constrained devices
additional language bindings
