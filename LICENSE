## Why Dual Licensing?

HSIP is designed as **commons infrastructure** - freely accessible to individuals, researchers, educators, and non-profits. This ensures privacy technology remains a public good.

Commercial licensing supports:
- Ongoing development and maintenance
- Independent security audits
- Platform ports (Linux, macOS, mobile)
- Community documentation and support
- Interoperability standards work

By keeping HSIP free for non-commercial use while licensing commercial use, we can sustain the project without paywalls or subscription fees for individuals.
