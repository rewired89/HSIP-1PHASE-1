**HSIP Funding Roadmap**

HSIP is a consent-first communication protocol designed to give users cryptographic control over who can contact them.
The goal is to modernize communication privacy at the transport layer — openly, transparently, and for public benefit.

Grant funding accelerates development while keeping the core protocol 100% open source and driven by community needs.

**1. Completed Work (Foundational Phase)**
The initial HSIP implementation includes:
dentity and key system (Ed25519/X25519)
Consent token model with time-bound capabilities
Encrypted session channel
Replay protection and session safeguards
Windows gateway & CLI tooling
Comprehensive documentation
Zero unsafe Rust code in the core
The project is stable and ready for broader adoption.

**2. Next 12–18 Months (Funding-Critical)**
A. Cross-Platform Support
Goal: Bring HSIP to Linux and macOS.
This expands accessibility, enables community contributions, and allows independent auditing across ecosystems.

B. Mobile Libraries
Goal: Native iOS and Android bindings.
Mobile consent flows give HSIP real-world impact for non-technical users.

C. Advanced Networking
Goal: Improve connectivity and reliability across diverse network conditions.
This includes optional privacy-preserving peer discovery and stronger NAT traversal.

D. Group Communication
Goal: Multi-party consent-based communication.
A modern alternative to traditional messaging backends, aligned with HSIP’s privacy model.

E. Production Hardening
Goal: Prepare HSIP for adoption by NGOs, journalists, and public-interest organizations.
Includes additional testing, documentation, and a third-party security review.

3. Public Benefit
Grant support enables:
A universal, open consent layer for secure communication
Strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing usability
Adoption in high-risk communities (activists, journalists, vulnerable populations)
Strengthened open-source ecosystem through new tools, libraries, and documentation
Transparent governance, public code, and community participation
HSIP is designed to remain open, auditable, and accessible at every stage.

4. Sustainability Plan (High-Level)
HSIP uses a hybrid sustainability model:
Open source protocol + community license
Optional commercial support for organizations
Long-term plan to move governance to a neutral foundation
Community-driven roadmap and public development
Transparent release cycles
This ensures long-term viability without compromising openness.

5. Requested Support
Funding will be used for:
Full-time development
Cross-platform expansion
Mobile libraries
Networking improvements
Security review

Public documentation and examples

All work resulting from grants remains fully open source.
